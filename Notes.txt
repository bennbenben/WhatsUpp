To Do (in priority):
1. Integrate socket io -> for latestMessage / sidebarchat. Remaining action is happening inside SidebarLayout.jsx
  >>> sender does not update
  >>> receiver receives the signal, state is updating, but is not rendering
  >>> displayChatrooms is not re-rendering even though the state is updating

2. User needs to re-login after refresh *consult
  >>> am half-considering creating a custom useAuth() hook to put inside the <PrivateRoute />

3. Bugfix/why cannot close drawer + createbar *consult
4. long message breaks the CSS -> need text wrap
5. Logout in the 3 dots button
  >>> dispatch() already has a logout action configured, just need the dropdown menu + button
6. Style modal for addNewChat
7. Message timestamp change to GMT+8


Bonus:
6. Read/unread status
4. Refresh token
fix login/register css
styled components
Unprotected routes - register/pw change(?) - KIV, need consult Siewla about warning + Refresh tokens

Before commit: need change back the local connectionURI
