To Do (in priority):
1. Integrate socket io -> for latestMessage / sidebarchat. Remaining action is happening inside SidebarLayout.jsx
2. User needs to re-login after refresh
  >>> am half-considering creating a custom useAuth() hook to put inside the <PrivateRoute />
3. Logout in the 3 dots button
  >>> dispatch() already has a logout action configured, just need the dropdown menu + button
4. Bugfix/why cannot close drawer + createbar
5. Style modal for addNewChat
6. Read/unread status

Bonus:
4. Refresh token
fix login/register css
styled components
Unprotected routes - register/pw change(?) - KIV, need consult Siewla about warning + Refresh tokens

Before commit: need change back the local connectionURI
