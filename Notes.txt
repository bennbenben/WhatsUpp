Notes on the App
1. Web Socket used now, is only emitting signal to all but sender
  - we manually update the sender using context

2. SideBarChatLayout currently has no dependency array
  - by right should have, and should work as code is correct


Bonus/Stretch Goals:
- Read/unread status
- Refresh token
- Message timewstamps for different timezones

Before commit: need change back the local connectionURI
